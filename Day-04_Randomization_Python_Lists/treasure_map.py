# You are going to write a program that will mark a spot with an X.

# In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.

# This map contains a nested list. When map is printed this is what the nested list looks like:

# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

# In the starting code, we have used new lines (\n) to format the three rows into a square, like this:

# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

# This is to try and simulate the coordinates on a real map.


row1 = ["⬜️", "⬜️", "⬜️"]
row2 = ["⬜️", "⬜️", "⬜️"]
row3 = ["⬜️", "⬜️", "⬜️"]
map = [row1, row2, row3]
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
position = str(input("Where do you want to put the treasure? "))


first_letter = int(position[0]) - 1
second_letter = int(position[1]) - 1

map[second_letter][first_letter] = 'X'


print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
